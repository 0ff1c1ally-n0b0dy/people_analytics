# People analytics
This is an ongoing project and a lot more still needs to be done.
So far:
* _HRDataset_v14.csv_ is the dataset used here. It was obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set?resource=download
* _KModes_demo_V1.ipynb_ is the code for KModes clustering analysis on demographic variables only. The intention is to create a bunch of demographic profiles
  and say each employee which profile fits. 
* _anomaly_within_clusterV2.ipynb_ is the code for detecting employees with abnormal salaries, satisfactions, performance scores, etc. with respect to the demographic
profile found by the KModes code. 
* _EDA_V5.ipynb_ is the code for creating all sorts of plots similar to the ones found on the following 
website: https://www.humano.ro/hr-data-management-and-visualization-powerful-insights/ 
* _Data visualization for HR.pdf_ contains some examples of plots created by the _EDA_ code from the previous bullet point.
